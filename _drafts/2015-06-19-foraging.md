I'd never seen it in my garden before, but all of a sudden it was everywhere. I don't know if it was just the right season, my unobservant nature, or the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon, but this food that barely a month ago I wasn't even aware of was now prolific in my backyard. I didn't plant it, I didn't water it, there was no need for pesticides, no repotting, no fertilising, and no weeding. I just picked it and ate it whenever I wanted. It was the perfect plant.

In fact, the reason that my new favorite food didn't require any weeding is that it was the weed - chickweed, or Stellaria media to be precise. Many people consider chickweed to be a weed because of its invasive nature. To me, the ability to grow and spread quickly, to thrive in a variety of soil types, moisture regimes and light conditions, and its nutritional value make it very desirable.

Chickweed is a source of A, B, and C vitamins, as well as flavonoids and various minerals. [<a href="http://www.nutrition-info.com/herbs/herbs-chickweed.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ref</a>]
