JRE#509 with Steve Hilton 42:00 

Only a tiny number of people fund political campaigns compared to the number of voters and within that the majority of the money comes from an even smaller number of people. These people pay for everything and they get the outcomes that they pay for.
Why do politicians care about money more than votes if votes are what gets them into power? Because there are too many silly people out there who's vote can be bought with an expensive marketing campaign. Money = votes.

Look or leaked document to New York Times on the democratic leadership congress directed at newly elected members of congress with recommendations on how to spend their time. The recommendation was to spend 4 hours a day on fund raising.

Steve's co founder Adam is a professor at Stanford and has found out that the best guide to know what a politician / political party is actually going to do in office is to look at where their money is coming from and where they donate money to. 

Quote rush hour: follow the rich white dude.

Summarise the political parties and where their money comes from.

Look into Larry Lesig at Harvard for an opinion on money on politics.
