- Donna Bionda, December 2022, Spaghetti Carbonara
  - This was quite disappointing. I was hoping for good quality Italian style pasta when I decided to go here but what I got was a bastardisation that would make any Italian very angry. The onions were barely cooked, the pasta was way over al dente, they used bacon instead of cured ham, and the serving size was modest. Supposedly it was tossed in a creamy garlic confit sauce but all I tasted was cream... amateurs. I would have been happy if I had paid $18, but it was $25.50.
