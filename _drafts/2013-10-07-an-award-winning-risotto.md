The hostel I live in sees many chefs come through. There are 3 chefs living here right now, and I've known a handful of others in the year that I've been here.  One of these chefs worked with a man named ________. One day she cooked him a risotto. After he tried it his first question was, "where did you learn to make risotto like this?". When she told him that she learnt it at culinary school, he proceeded to teach her how to make a real risotto. She taught me, and you're about to read what I learned. Keep in mind that you're hearing this 3rd hand so I can't guarantee that some Chinese whispers haven't occurred.

One of the biggest mistakes you can make - and also the easiest to fix - when making risotto is adding the cheese too early. The cheese must be the very last thing you add. If you add it too early when the pan is still on the heat, the cheese will melt and turn stringy which will make your risotto glugy, and seem like it was cooked in the microwave. Once you've got the consistency and the seasoning just right, remove the pan from the heat, stir in the cheese, then serve immediately.

Speaking of cheese reminds me of another common mistake; people usually add too much. If you add too much it overpowers the other flavours. That is also why you shouldn't add too many ingredients. Stick to rice, some kind of onion, cheese, and no more than 3 other ingredients. Even 3 could be too many depending on what you pick. You want to be able to taste everything.

The last sticking point you might run into with risotto is texture. You need to always be thinking about the texture and asking yourself questions like, if I add these mushrooms now, will they be ready when the rice is ready?  When you finish your risotto, the consistency should be creamy. If it's not add some butter or a little stock/water. The risotto should be just runny enough to sauté and not sloppy.   Keep these 3 things in mind when you read the following recipe.

Ingredients:
Aborio rice
Asparagus (halved cross ways)
Onion (diced)
Butter
Mushrooms (diced like onions)
Tomato (diced)
Parmegano regiano/Parmesan cheese (buy it solid, not grated)

Boil asparagus in stock ~2 mins then into ice cold water. Retain hot asparagus water. Fry 1 onion diced in butter, +arborio rice &amp; mix to coat each grain of rice in fat. Soonish after, Add asparagus water ~ rice is almost covered. When water has almost evaporated top it up again. Keep water topped up~ almost done ~15mins. When nearly done add mushrooms and tomato. When rice is done add asparagus &amp; butter, stir. Adjust seasoning and consistency (if required), remove from heat and grate in Parmesan (not too much). Stir through the Parmesan and serve immediately. 

When the rice is done it should be al dente.
