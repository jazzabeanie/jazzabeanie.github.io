I recently came accross the realisation that the real secrets of cooking most dishes come from cooking them again and again and again. You can read about that here-LINK. Gambas al Pil Pil is so simple, which makes it the perfect example to illustrate my point. I've cooked this many times over the past few months and I've not gotten it to a point where I'm happy with it. Well, a version that doesn't include pimentón anyway. Adding pimentón bring a level of complexity that I don't have time for right now. There are a lot of jokers out there these days putting up recipes that aren't actually any good. In an attempt to show the good readers of this blog that this recipe is legit, I've included my notes at the end of the post. Scroll to the bottom to see how I came to recipe for Gambas al Pil Pil. There are a few problems with Gambas al Pil Pil in my opinion:

*   Typically the leftover oil and garlic is soaked up with bread. While this is absolutely delicious, gluten has been getting criticised lately by many people with credibility[[ref](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H4EPCGW?btkr=1), [ref](http://www.cerealkillersmovie.com/), [ref](http://www.direct-ms.org/pdf/EvolutionPaleolithic/Cereal%20Sword.pdf), [ref](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2010/09/19/paleo-diet-solution/)], so I'd like to avoid the bread.
*   It's just a tapa, which means if you want to serve it for dinner, you have to think of something else to go with it.
