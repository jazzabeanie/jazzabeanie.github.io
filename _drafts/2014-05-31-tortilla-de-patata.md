Tortilla de Patata or Spanish Omelet is pretty Â¿unassuming?. I must admit that when I first tried it I though nothing of it. It looked very basic and tasted like it looked. But now I am fully converted. I realise that though it is very simple, there is a real art to making a good one. And when it's good, it's GOOOD!!

The bare essentials for a tortilla are potatoes, eggs, oil, and salt. Sounds easy but I once heard of a good chef who would test potential employees by asking them to cook and an egg as the liked. If you've read POACHED EGGS HARVARD STYLE then you'll know why. Eggs are very sensitive to slight temperature changes. So if you want a particular texture of your tortilla, you better use exactly the right amount of heat and take it off at exactly exalt the right time. Potatoes can also be difficult to work with. If you've seen the lengths that Heaton Blumenthal or ___________ go to just to get a nice crispy coating on a potato chip, you know what I'm talking about.
