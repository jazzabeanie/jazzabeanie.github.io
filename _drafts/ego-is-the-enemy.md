"There is humility engender by looking closely at what you're calling your self, and seeing that you didn't make yourself. Your strengths are a gift. You can't really claim that you are the author of anything good that you find in yourself."
--Sam Harris

## Chapter 1: Talk Talk Talk
Ryan argues that you shouldn't tell people about your goals.

>"Never give reasons for what you think or do until you must. Maybe after a while, a better reason will pop into you head."
>--Sherman (B.H. Liddell Hart)

>"Mere gossip anticipates real talk and to express what is still in thought weakens action for forestalling it."
>--Soren Kierkegaard

He says that **talking and doing fight for the same resources** (the resources need to take action). This reminds of the not complaining challenge that many people have written about. I highly recommend this. One of the side effects of not complaining about your problems is that it makes you much more likely to take action to fix them.

He cites [a study](http://www.theemotionmachine.com/keep-your-goals-to-yourself), saying that while goal visualisation is important, after a certain point our mind begins to confuse it with actual progress. I would agree with this. It makes me thing of how unreliable the human memory is. A quote comes to mind:

>"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool."
>--Richard Feynman

Ryan then references [a study (which I could not find)](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xge/122/2/166.html) saying that talking aloud to ourselves while we work though difficult problems has been shown to significantly decrease insight and breakthroughs.i

This one I'm not sure I agree with, and I can't check the source to answer my questions. Why does talking aloud matter? Does talking to someone else about a problem have the same effect? If not, what's the difference? My life experience doesn't agree. I personally get a benefit from talking through a problem to myself. 

If the only problem is that talking to our self give us the illusion of progress, then there may still be something that can be done to mitigate this effect. If after talking through a problem, I have not come to a solution, I should summarise my position to make sure that my idea of my progress is accurate.

What about the idea (potentially from Tim Ferriss) that we should tell as many people as possible about our goals so that we are kept socially accountable? This seems to conflict with the advice given here. I also thing of Dorian Yates on JRE #989 at around 0:34. He says recommends writing your goals on a piece of paper, signing it and putting it somewhere you will see it everyday. What about the concept of affirmations? Scott Adams [talks about this on the Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/2015/09/22/scott-adams-the-man-behind-dilbert/).

In my experience (and based on the work of Josh Waitzkin) asking yourself a question about a problem gets the subconscious mind thinking about it. I find it a very useful tool in problem solving. If what Ryan is saying can align with my experience, there is an optimal amount of talk that should be done about a problem, which might be just enough to utilise the subconscious, but not so much that we feel like we've done sufficient work.

In the end it probably comes down to you the individual and this advise about not talking too much should only apply to certain people. Do you talk about problems as a form of procrastination? Do you complain about your problems but never actually act on them?

## Chapter 3: Becoming a student

I often like to tackle my problems alone, informed by multiple sources. This chapter reminded me of the value of having a single teacher. It makes you more humble. It gives you someone to attribute the credit of your wins. But how does this fit with the advice of Bruce Lee? "Absorb what is useful, discard what is useless and add what is specifically your own" It seems like he would encourage having multiple teachers.

"It is impossible to learn that which one thinks one already knows."
--Epictetus

"The pretence of knowledge is our most dangerous vice because it prevents us from getting any better." This reminds me of the Zen saying, ["Empty your cup"](https://www.thoughtco.com/empty-your-cup-3976934). How do we catch ourselves when we think we know something already? Take the phrase "I know" out of your vocabulary and replace it with, "I know a little bit about that".

And what do you do when you legitimately do know what you are being told? I propose recalling what you already know and asking for feedback. For example, "The way I understand it - and let me know if I miss anything here - is...". In this way you are testing your own knowledge and if the response is anything but, "that's exactly right", then you aren't as good as you thought you were.

Always stay a student. Seek out those that know more than you and knock down the illusions that you have about yourself. ACTION: Add the following question to your regular life reflection, "Have I been a student?".

"Each fighter, to become great, needs to have someone better that they can learn from, someone better that they can teach, and someone equal that they can challenge themselves against."
-- Frank Shamrock on his training system called Plus, Minus, and Equal.

Shamrock's system is designed to give us feedback on what we know and don't know from every angle. The Plus and Minus aspects can be applied to any discipline - competitive or otherwise.

"The art of taking feedback is such a crucial skill in life, particularly hash and critical feedback". Ryan suggests seeking out critical feedback but doesn't say how to recognise this feedback without the ego getting in the way. Sometimes, when we are getting criticised, our automatic reaction is to get defensive. ACTION: To address this, add the following question to your regular life reflection, "When have I received criticism lately?"

People who give honest, critical feedback can be hard to find. Work hard to keep them in your life.
 
## Chapter 4: Don't Be Passionate

Passion can blind you into believing in yourself or in an idea when there is no evidence that you should. The biggest mistake someone can make regarding passion is that it's the most important thing. Ryan has no time for passion, but if you are humbled and intimidated by the size of the task ahead of you, how to you overcome the challenges which might take great effort if you have zero passion?

If you can avoid the pitfalls, passion will help you. Otherwise it will drive you to failure. 

How can you make sure passion doesn't dominate your decision making? When making big decision, quantify your level of passion and it's rank in affecting your decision. Make sure you leave time to detach emotionally, and do higher self meditation to help the process.

How can you call on passion in difficult time? Add inspiring things to Evernote with the tag "inspiration". ACTION: Add "How is my passion for __BLANK__ ?" to your goal review. Keep track of movies, fiction books, and other entertainment on the subject of your passion. Use this when you need a break so that you recuperate your passion while you rest.

## Chapter 5: Find Canvases of Other People

This chapter reminded me of something I heard on a Podcast once, "it's amazing what you can get done when you don't need to take credit for the work".

Do you have a feeling of entitlement? If so then re-read this chapter.

## Chapter 6: Restrain Yourself (Chapter 10)

Control your anger and don't let it play into your decisions. This is easier said than done. Sometimes we find ourself in situations where know we shouldn't do something but we physically can't stop ourselves. Anger will often do this.

ACTION: Work meditation into your daily routine. This will help you do pull yourself out of anger before you do something regrettable.

## Chapter 7: Get Out of Your Head (Chapter 11)

This chapter is about the stream of thoughts that tell you how good you are. The thoughts themselves are not the problem. The problem is getting stuck in the through stream and believing it. If we catch yourselves in this thought stream then we remove it's power. Meditation will help with this. If you find this stream of egotistical thoughts to be a constant problem, then create a reminder in your calendar with the following quote:

"You can't really claim that you are the author of anything good that you find in yourself."
--Sam Harris

Consider avoiding situations that inflate the ego. In social situations, give away credit to others, even when it is rightfully yours.

Keep your diary private. If you ever share the contents of your diary, make sure you read it privately first. Make sure that your diary is a safe place for honest thoughts. These simple rules will mitigate against creating a system that leads you to filter your own thoughts.

## Chapter 8: The Danger of Early Pride (Chapter 12)

Pride dulls the sense of negative feedback, robbing you of an opportunity to grow.

"If you can't swallow your pride, you can't lead. Pride will be harder to subdue than a wild lion. Even the tallest mountains have animals, that when they stand on it, are higher than the mountain."
--Genghis Kahn

Jocko Willink would agree that pride and leadership don't mix.

It is good to be on guard against haters, but we should be even more on guard against the our own ego. When you feel pride, ask your self this question, "what am I missing now, that a more humble person might see?".

ACTION: Consider the following questions in your monthly life reflection, "When have I been overly proud lately? When have I boasted? What was I missing in that moment that a more humble person would have seen?".

## Chapter 9: Work, Work, Work (Audible Chapter 13)

Many of these issues seem like they would be helped by meditation. Action: meditate.

"According to Seneca, the Greek word Eutemia is one we should think of often. It is the sense of our own path and how to stay on it without getting distracted by all the others that intersect it. It's not about beating or having more than the other guy. It's about being what you are and being as good as possible at it without succumbing to all the things that draw you away from it. It's about going where you set out to go. It's about accomplishing the most you are capable of in what you choose. No more. No Less. By the way, Eutemia means tranquillity in English. It's time to sit down and think about what's truly important to you and then take steps to forsake the rest. Without this success will not be pleasurable or nearly as complete as it could be. Or worse, it won't last. This is especially true with money. If you don't know how much you need, the default easily becomes €“ More. And so without thinking, critical energy is diverted from a person's calling and toward filling a bank account."
- Ryan Holiday in Ego Is the Enemy

I think it's good to review this from time to time. ACTION: Make a new Future me letter for the future.
