I recently came across an article Can a pedophile be good person?

Our society has a lock-em-up-and-throw-away-the-key type view on these people.

Though some people's motive might be revenge, in this case, revenge and justice result in the same action as abusing a child is one of the worst crime a human can commit. But even justice is holding our society back.

Lets look at a different example. Our society deems 14 year in prison justice for armed robbery. Fair enough you might say. But currently the chance of reoffending once a prisoner is released from jail is _____. What if I told you we could reduce that risk of reoffending to ____% by 6 months in therapy without any prison time? would that be an acceptable outcome? if you said no then you value justice over rehabilitation and this mindset is holding our society back.

People get into the penal system because of our unwillingness to provide support to people who desperately need it like low income earner, single mother, and drug addicts. They stay in that system because of our unwillingness to help them to get out. Let me give an example.

Boy has shitty parents, goes to a juvenile correctional facility. Looks for a rolemodel, finds only deliquints, become a delinquint himself. Eventually goes to prison. Get out of prison and has no education, no family or friends willing to support him to get back on track with his life, and a criminal record. The chances or reoffending are high.
