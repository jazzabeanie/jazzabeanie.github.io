Saturday 7th of July was the first bull run of the San Ferm√≠n festival. It was also the most crowded. We caught the very first bus in at 5:30am. A lot of Spaniards were still out partying or asleep in the park or the bus stop. We went to the spot that an experienced friend told me about which was on the inside just before a 90 degree turn called "dead man's corner". There were so many people that you could hardly moved. It wasn't as bad as the opening ceremony but there was no way anyone was going to run in the pack. The police made a line right through the middle or the crowd (very close to us) and kicked out hundreds of people.

When the police opened up the line it was almost 8am. Everyone started running. We did too, not that we has a choice. We stopped running just after dead man's corner and waited on the inside. I put the go pro on and started filming. Everyone was pretty nervous. I started talking to the people around us an. It was everyone's first time. They all looked like giris (spanish for gringo's). I looked to the other side and everyone standing there looked like a Spanish veteran. It seems like everybody on outside had heard what we had heard; that you need to avoid the outside at "dead man's corner). I'd heard that the Spanish were crazy, but surely they weren't that crazy...

I decides that if the bulls were going to fall over they would fall about 10 meters up from where we were and we would be fine. I saw a guys in his early 30's who had a tattoo of a bull on his arm and looked like he'd done it a thousand times. I crossed the street and stood beside him.

A rocket was fired to indicate that the bulls had been released and everyone cheered. About 10 seconds later people started to run. All we could see was more and more people coming around dead mans corner, running faster with ever second.

All of a sudden people were around that corner as fast as they could. They were running for their lives with looks of terror in their faces. The air was filled with the sound of stampeding hooves and horrible screams.

I didn't wait to see a bull, I just started running as fast as I could. I moved into the middle of the street where there was less congestion and I could run faster. I was pushing people assist all over the place. I glanced behind me to check where bulls where and I turned back just in time to see the slow old lady I was just about to collide with. The back of her head hit me straight in the mouth. I don't know if she went down or what but I didn't stop. Next second the bulls were on me. The first one passed me about a meter to my right. It was massive, it's horns at about my chest height and weighing around 500kg. I kept dodging and when the 2nd bull passed me I was even closer. I had a bit more space and I kept up with it. I wanted to touch it, all I had to do was reach out. But I didn't because I'd heard that it was frowned upon.

With someone in my way I had to slow down again. A 3rd and a 4th bull passed me, all within arms reach. The last bull passed so close that it's horn was inches away from my body. I tries to keep up with it and follow just behind but there were too many people.

I made the first check point just after the gate was closed. And I was funnelled into a side street. My lip was bleeding and my front tooth ached badly. I stayed here and filmed the rest of the bulls run past. Then I went into a bar to watch the rest of the run and the bulls charging in the arena.

It was the most intense experience of my life.
