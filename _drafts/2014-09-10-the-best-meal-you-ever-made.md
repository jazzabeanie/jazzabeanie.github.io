title: "The Best Meal You Ever Made"

In early June of 2014 I had one of the best meals of my life. On my way to Cadiz, my hosts in Estepona took me out to [Taberna Miguel ](http://www.tripadvisor.es/Restaurant_Review-g187437-d4593886-Reviews-Taberna_Miguel-Estepona_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html)restaurant. The highlight of the night - Gambas al Pil Pil. Prawns cooked in garlic, parsley and olive oil, served in a cazuela de barro. The prawns were amazing, as prawns almost always are, and when they were gone I soaked up the oil left at the bottom with fresh, crusty bread. I immediately put this recipe on my to-do list. When I eat Gambas al Pil Pil I am reminded of a similar dish I had in July of 2012 at the markets near Soulac Sur Mer called crevette flambé au pastis. I enjoyed this dish so much also, that I keenly watched the cook preparing the dish and observed the recipe. The distractions of travel ensued so I never actually got around to cooking it. CHECK CODE HERE:

> Fry about 10 <span class="highlight">prawns</span> in olive oil for a couple of minutes. Add a dash of pastis/whisky to the pan (maybe a tablespoon), cover the pan with a lid then use a BBQ lighter to flambé the pan. The <span class="highlight">alcohol</span> will ignite and should go out in about 10 seconds. Continue to fry the <span class="highlight">prawns</span> for about 30 seconds. Add 2 tablespoons of premixed <span class="highlight">garlic</span> and parsley (and maybe olive oil?) and fry for about 10 seconds. Serve.

When I established myself in Cadiz, and by that I mean moved into a flat and bought a cazuela de barro LINK!!, I searched for a recipe for Gambas al Pil Pil. This is a translation of the recipe I found(LINK):

> Chop 5-6 cloves of garlic, chilli to taste, parsley (a bunch I guess?), and mush together in a pestle and mortar until you have an amalgamated paste. In a cazuela de barro (on medium heat I guess?), add extra virgin olive oil and when hot, add the paste. Once all ingredients are golden, add the prawns and leave for 3 or 4 minutes. Finally, sprinkle over a teaspoon of pimentón. Serve.

I didn't follow this vague recipe exactly because I didn't have a pestle and mortar, and I didn't have fresh parsley, only freshly made parsley butter. After cooking I made the following observations:

*   The Gambas al Pil Pil I had at Taberna Miguel had sliced garlic, not a garlic and parsley paste.
*   3 or 4 minutes is probably too long, at least for the prawns that I had which I bough pre blanched (half cooked I guess).
*   A teaspoon of pimentón is too much for my liking.
*   I added too much chilli.

I also noticed that I couldn't tell if I'd burnt the garlic or not. This has never happened to me. There's a very fine line between burned and not burned garlic and I must have been sitting right on it. I couldn't tell if I liked it or not, but by the end of the meal I decided that I really did. This all got me thinking about the subtleties of cooking. Do you slice, finely chop, or make a paste out of the garlic? Do you add the garlic and parsley at the end or at the start? Did the fact that I used butter and oil make a noticeable difference? 

These questions probably wouldn't matter to an untrained palate. If the average Joe ate three dishes like this, he would probably only remember one of them as being the best, and the tiny difference in taste might not even play a role. So much of our perception of food is dependant on the context we are eating it in. But if you want the very best, everything counts. 

My favourite meal to this day is spaghetti bolognese. Dad would cook this every week or two as I was growing up. I would walk through the front of the house after training, get a big whiff of sautéing onions, and run downstairs so fucking excited only to find brief disappointment in the fact that we were having burritos, not spaghetti. And I loved burritos too, but nothing could match my dad's spaghetti bolognese. Even when I cooked it with Dad's recipe it wasn't the same. 

My whole family had senses highly attuned to spaghetti bolognese. We could tell if the current batch of tomatoes were more acidic than usual and this meant that for the next few weeks or months our spaghetti would taste different. If, gods forbid, the supermarket had run out of the preferred brand of tin tomatoes and Dad had to buy a different one, we knew immediately. Same with the brand or size of the pasta. And damn those diets! Does a single spoonful of sugar really have to be omitted? It's amazing how much the smallest change was immediately noticeable. 

Yet, if we are talking about Gambas al Pil Pil, I don't have that same awareness. I know that the one I had at Taberna Miguel was better than the one I made at home, but I can only guess why. The [Art of Learning](http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Learning-Journey-Performance/dp/0743277465) has taught me that repetition internalises ideas into your subconscious, freeing your conscious mind to focus on other things, like the acidity of the tomato for example. 

Anthony Bourdain speaks about the street food in Hong Kong or Singapore as being among the best in the world. The street chefs only cook one dish their whole lives, and it's the same dish their father cooked, and their grandfather. That is why the food is so amazing. All of this has lead me to the realisation that there is only one way to find the best recipe for any dish, and that is to cook it again and again and again until you know how everything should be done exactly. There are too many meals out there to be able to cook everything to perfection. One must be selective. As [Robert Rodriguez advises](http://youtu.be/Vrw5FkLutWk?t=4m8s), build a list of your favourite dishes and cook them regularly. Gambas al Pil Pil is going on my list.
