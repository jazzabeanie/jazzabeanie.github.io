How to be romantic
==================

I need to be better at this. Particularly once I get established in a relationship. Here are my thoughts on how to do it. I will keep working on this and if I can't think of anything in the moment, I will consult this list.

I think being romantic might just be acting as if you are dating. The reason it's so hard in an established relationship is you stop courting. By that logic, any activity that would be good as date would probably be good as a romantic gesture.

Cliches
-------

There are many cliches in this area. I suspect they still work, but I will keep them in a separate category:

- buy flowers
- hide love letters somewhere she will find them when you're not around
- run a hot bath and surround it with candles
- take a dance class
- give a foot massage without expecting one in return

New ideas
---------

- pick some flowers from the street, put them in a little jar of water, then hide them somewhere in your room. The next day give them to her first thing in the morning and say, "these flowers have been waiting since yesterday to see how beautiful you are".
- keep a playlist for slow dancing - the kind of music that highschool kids would find every exciting as a school dance. Play it occasionally and slow dance in the kitchen while you're cooking dinner.
- carve a small wooden stamp with both of your initials and a love heart.
- take a cup of tea to the street and go people watching.
- break up the routine
  - organise something mundane to keep her free, then pick her up from work and go on a date instead.
