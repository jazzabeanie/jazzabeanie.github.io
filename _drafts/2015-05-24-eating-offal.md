<div>The idea of eating offal doesn’t really get a lot of people salivating. In just a few short decades, we have been convinced that some animal organs are delicious, and some are disgusting. A quick chat with your grandparents should convince you, but if hard data is what you want, have a look at this example from the UK:</div>
<div>According to the Meat and Livestock Commission in 1977, 105,000 tonnes of organ meat were sold in the UK but by 2002 this had fallen to 19,500 tonnes.[ref:<a href="http://offalgood.com/2007/03/who-are-the-modern-offal-eaters/">http://offalgood.com/2007/03/who-are-the-modern-offal-eaters/</a>]</div>
<div>Let’s look at a goat for example. The portion of the 30 kg goat normally regarded as edible in Australia, the carcass, liver, heart, intestines, spleen, brains, rumen and kidney fat amounted to about 16.4 kg or 54.7%.[ref:<a href="http://www.depi.vic.gov.au/agriculture-and-food/livestock/goats/goat-produce-and-industry/meat-and-offal-yields-of-goats">http://www.depi.vic.gov.au/agriculture-and-food/livestock/goats/goat-produce-and-industry/meat-and-offal-yields-of-goats</a>] The carcass amounts to around 45% of the live weight, and edible offal to around 10%. Keeping in mind that a lamb carcass will yield approximately 65% edible meat[ref:<a href="http://animalscience.psu.edu/extension/meat/pdf/The%20Butcher%20Stole%20My%20Meat.pdf">http://animalscience.psu.edu/extension/meat/pdf/The%20Butcher%20Stole%20My%20Meat.pdf</a>}, we can estimate that a goat will give us about 30% of it’s live body weight in meat, and 10% in edible offal.</div>
<div>Put simply, if you were raising your own goats for meat, you would expect to eat offal at least once every 4 days.</div>
<div>The world we life in today is madness. We hire hitmen to kill our animals. We've forgotten what it means to take a life. We see meat as a food that comes from our supermarket shelves and we don’t like anything that reminds us of what it used to be.</div>
<div>The offal that we neglect to eat gets used in very inefficient ways. It gets turned into fertiliser, cosmetics, pet food, etc.</div>
