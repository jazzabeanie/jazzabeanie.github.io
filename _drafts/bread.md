In order to make good bread consistently, you need to learn a few principles. If you know the principles and how to read the dough you can make great bread every time, without measuring everything. These are the principles I follow to make bread that several people have told me is the best they've ever had.

The basic steps to making bread are:

- mix the dough
- develop the gluten
- ferment the dough until the optimal time
- shape and proof the dough
- bake in a high humidity environment
- finish in a low humidity environment

Ingredients
-----------

- W factor
- protein as a proxy for gluten
- yeast

Mix the dough
-------------

I bake my loaves at between 70 and 80 percent hydration. This means that the amount of water (by mass) is 70 to 80 percent of the amount of flour. When following bakers recipes, all the ingredients are given relative to the amount of flour. So, if you have a recipe with 50% water and 2% salt, and you choose to use 500g of flour, you will add 250g of water and 10g of salt. If you always use the same flour and are well practiced, you should be able to know the hydration just by the feel of the dough. Until then, best to weigh your ingredients. 

First time you make it, measure 75% hydration. Notice the texture and how it feels, notice how much dry flour you can see. Touch the dough and notice how sticky it is. Notice the resistance it gives when you stir it. The next time you make a loaf, measure the water, then add flour until you think you are at about the same consistency as before, then measure how much flour you added to see how you did. Do this a few times and you will be pretty good at eye-balling dough hydration.
