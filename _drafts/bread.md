In order to make good bread consistently, you need to learn a few principles. If you know the principles and how to read the dough you can make great bread every time, without measuring everything. These are the principles I follow to make bread that several people have told me is the best they've ever had.

The basic steps to making bread are:

- mix the dough
- develop the gluten
- ferment the dough until the optimal time
- shape and proof the dough
- bake in a high humidity environment
- finish in a low humidity environment

Ingredients
-----------

- W factor
- protein as a proxy for gluten
- yeast
- sourdough starter (40g of water, 50g of flour)

Mix the dough
-------------

I bake my loaves at between 70 and 80 percent hydration. This means that the amount of water (by mass) is 70 to 80 percent of the amount of flour. When following bakers recipes, all the ingredients are given relative to the amount of flour. So, if you have a recipe with 50% water and 2% salt, and you choose to use 500g of flour, you will add 250g of water and 10g of salt. If you always use the same flour and are well practiced, you should be able to know the hydration just by the feel of the dough. Until then, best to weigh your ingredients. 

> Training youself to eyeball everything: The first time you make bread, measure 75% hydration. Notice the texture and how it feels, notice how much dry flour you can see. Touch the dough and notice how sticky it is. Notice the resistance it gives when you stir it. The next time you make a loaf, measure the water, then add same brand of flour until you think you are at about the same consistency as before, then measure how much flour you added to see how you did. If you keep doing this you will soon be able to estimate hydration just be the feel of the dough.

- Mix the dough:
  - Measure out 350g of water in a mixing bowl (a glass mixing bowl is preferable as it allows you to see bubble development in the dough).
  - Add the yeast. If you are making sourdough, spoon some water into the starter container to help get the starter out, then add it all to the water. Roughly break up the start in the water.
  -  Add 500g of flour and mix until the flour and water are incorporated.
- Develop the gluten and bulk fermentation:
  - Let rest for roughly 15-45 mins. On hot days (26C+), or if are you adding more yeast or starter, go for shorter timeframes.
  - Add 1/3 of the salt then do a stretch and fold. Repeat 2 more times so that all the salt is added.
  - Cover and rest for 5 minutes.
  - Stretch and fold and then rest (covered) for 10 mins.
  - Stretch and fold and then rest (covered) for 15 mins.
  - Rest covered until bulk fermentation is complete.
- Shape and proof:
