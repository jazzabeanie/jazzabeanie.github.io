One cannot simply just follow a recipe and make good bread. I guess you could, but the recipe would be so details and prescriptive that it would be practically impossible. Better to learn the principles, and how to read dough and you can make great bread every time, without measuring everything. These days I don't measure a single thing when I make bread and I have had several people tell me it's the best bread they've ever had.

The basic steps to making bread are:

- mix the dough
- develop the gluten
- ferment the dough until the optimal time
- shape the loaf
- bake the loaf in a high humidity environment
- finish the loaf in low humidity environment

Ingredients
-----------

- W factor
- protein as a proxy for gluten
- yeast

Mix the dough
-------------

I bake my loaves at between 70 and 80 percent hydration. This means that the amount of water (by mass) is 70 to 80 percent of the amount of flour. When following bakers recipes, all the ingredients are given in relative to the amount of flour. So, if you have a recipe with 50% water and 2% salt, and you choose to use 500g of flour, you will add 250g of water and 10g of salt. I am able to estimate the hydration of my dough by the look at feel because I have done it hundreds of times. You will probably need to measure your dough, water, and maybe salt until you are able to eyeball it. If you practice the right way it will not take that long. First time you make it, measure 75% hydration. Notice the texture and how it feels, notice how much dry flour you can see. Touch the dough and notice how sticky it is. Notice the resistance it gives when you stir it. The next time you make a loaf, measure the water, then add flour until you think you are at about the same consistency as before, then measure how much flour you added to see how you did. Do this a few times and you will be pretty good at eye-balling dough hydration.
