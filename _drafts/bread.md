description: The bread with the best effort to results ratio
---

This recipe is great because of it's flexibility. Once you start, plan to be around for the next hour. Then you can put the dough in the fridge and finish bulk fermentation hours later or the next day. When the dough is ready, you will need around 20 mins to shape the loaf. After this you can reserve the next 2 hours for baking, of you can put the shaped loaf in the fridge and be at home for for 2 hours the next day for baking.

In order to make good bread consistently, you need to learn a few principles. If you know the principles and how to read the dough you can make great bread every time, without measuring anything. These are the principles I follow to make bread that several people have told me is the best they've ever had.

The basic steps to making bread are:

- mix the dough
- develop the gluten
- ferment the dough until the optimal time
- shape and proof the loaf
- bake in a high humidity environment
- finish in a low humidity environment

Ingredients
-----------

This is a discussion on ingredients. For quantities, see the Recipe section.

- Flour
  - W factor
  - protein as a proxy for gluten
- yeast - I normally use yeast when I want to make bread quicker than my starter can deliver, or when I haven't fed my starter recently. When I use yeast, I use instant dried yeast. I store it in the freezer.
- sourdough starter (40g of water, 50g of flour)
  - feeding routine
- water
  - clorinated water may affect your starter, not sure. I use filtered water.

Bulk fermentation
-----------------

Being able to tell when bulk fermentation is complete is one of the most important parts of making good bread. You cannot simply follow a recipe in this regard becuase small changes in temperature and the quantity of yeast/starter used will significantly change the bulk fermentation time. For example, an 8 degree celcius (14.4F) increase in temperature will half the bulk fermentation time.

I use [the Bulk-O-Matic system](https://youtu.be/E-Z1Yle-VXA?si=rD8mWOZqtRgYnpGB&t=982), developed by the International Academy for Sourdough Baking Arts and Sciences, for determining when bulk fermentation is complete. [The whole video](https://youtu.be/E-Z1Yle-VXA?si=rD8mWOZqtRgYnpGB) is worth a watch, but they key points are at 16:22.

Shaping the dough
-----------------

There are many way to do this. The simplest I have found is to use [Ken Forkish's method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPdedk9gJLQ). I deviate from this in a couple of way.

1. I usually proof for 45 - 50 mins, because I'm in a warmer environment and that's enough time for the dutch oven to heat up.
2. I don't use a banneton basket. I found these to be more trouble than they're worth. Use any bowl, put a small, thin towel (like a tea towel or hanky) over the top of the bowl so that it's taught. Sprinkle flower over the surface. Place the shapped loaf (seam side down, as Ken does, which is imporant) into the bowl.
3. Sprinkle the top and sides with with flour. Fold the towel over the top and then put into a plastic bag to proof.

Starter feeding
---------------

I have no idea why, but many people maintain an amount of starter that requires you to throw a lot away every time you feed it. I prefer to keep enough starter so that the amount that I throw away is exactly the amount I will use to make bread. I find that a 300 gram jar of salsa is perfect. When I discard the starter, the tiny amount left in the jar is enough to make the next batch.

I used to feed the starter precisely 40 grams of water and 50 grams of flour. And once I got used to estimating hydration, I would measure 40 grams of water and eyeball the flour. Now I eyeball both. There are starters with all kinds of hydrations. It doesn't matter the hydration of your starter unless you are looking for something very specific. If you just want to make something good, it doesn't matter if you are out by 10 or 20%.

This amount of starter will comfortably make 1 or 2 loaves. The bulk fermentation time will change, but if you know how to read the dough that doesn't matter. If I want to make more than 2 loaves, I will use the starter to make more starter about 8 hours before I want to bake. Note that 8 hours is not a rule, some people bake with younger starters.

If I'm not baking again in the next 12 hours, I will leave my starter on the counter for an hour or 2 and then put it in the fridge. Before baking, I will "refresh" it 1-3 times by doing the feeding routine every 8-12 hours until I'm ready to bake.

Recipe
------

I bake my loaves at between 70 and 80 percent hydration. This means that the amount of water (by mass) is 70 to 80 percent of the amount of flour. When following bakers recipes, all the ingredients are given relative to the amount of flour. So, if you have a recipe with 50% water and 2% salt, and you choose to use 500g of flour, you will add 250g of water and 10g of salt. If you always use the same flour and are well practiced, you should be able to know the hydration just by the feel of the dough. Until then, best to weigh your ingredients. 

> Training youself to eyeball the quantities: The first time you make bread, measure 75% hydration. Notice the texture and how it feels, notice how much dry flour you can see. Touch the dough and notice how sticky it is. Notice the resistance it gives when you stir it. The next time you make a loaf, measure the desired quantity of water and measure the weight of the flour container, then add same brand of flour until you think you are at about the same consistency as before, then measure the flour container again to see how much flour you added. If you keep doing this you will soon be able to estimate hydration just be the feel of the dough. For salt, I usually do a medium sprinkly accross the surface and then a single fold. Do this 3 times and this is about 2% hydration. Eyeballing yeast is more difficult because it is so easy to put in too much. If you do add too much, you can slow the fermentation down by putting the dough in the fridge.

- Mix the dough:
  - Measure out 350g of water in a mixing bowl (a glass mixing bowl is preferable as it allows you to see bubble development in the dough).
  - Add the yeast. If you are making sourdough, spoon some water into the starter container to help get the starter out, then add it all to the water. Roughly break up the start in the water.
  -  Add 500g of flour and mix until the flour and water are incorporated.
- Develop the gluten and bulk fermentation:
  - Let rest for roughly 15-45 mins. On hot days (26C+), or if are you adding more yeast or starter, go for shorter timeframes.
  - Add 1/3 of the salt then do a stretch and fold. Repeat 2 more times so that all the salt is added.
  - Cover and rest for ~5 minutes.
  - Stretch and fold and then rest (covered) for ~10 mins.
  - Stretch and fold and then rest (covered) for ~15 mins.
  - Rest covered until bulk fermentation is complete.
- Shape and proof:
  - Use flour around the edges of the bowl to break the grip the dough has on the bowl.
  - Scoop the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
  - Fold the dough over twice (like you are folding a piece of paper in thirds).
  - Flip the dough over and move it to an unfloured surface.
  - Scoop the dough towards you. The unfloured counter and your pinky fingers will help to pull the dough tight and seal the bottom.
  - Put the dough into a bowl with a floured towel. Fold the towel over the top then put into a plastic bag. Set aside to proof on the counter if you are going to cook in the next hour, in the fridge otherwise.
  - If baking soon, put the dutch oven in the oven and preheat to ~250C (428F) for ~50 mins. By the time the oven is ready the loaf should be proofed. If you have proofed overnight in the fridge, the dough can go straight from the fridge to the oven.
- Bake:
  - take the loaf out, unfold the towl and flip onto a piece of baking paper. Peel the towel off the dough, if it sticks you a butter knife can assist, but use more flour next time.
  - use the baking paper to lower the dough into the dutch oven.
  - cover and bake for 20 mins for a smaller loaf and 30 mins for a large one. A loaf with 500g of flour will need about 25 mins.
  - Uncover and continue to bake for antoher 15 minutes or until the top is browned to your liking. Don't be afraid to go nice a brown.
  - Remove from the dutch oven, remove the baking paper and rest on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes (preferably more) before slicing.
 
I usually eat it fresh only on the first day. After that I will slice it, bag it up and put it in the freezer. I normally eat it lightly toasted with vegemite and butter or vegemite and avocado.
