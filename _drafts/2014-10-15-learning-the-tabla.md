In my quest to learn the tabla I am applying my favourite principles from 4-hour Chef and a The Art of Learning. These books together are amazing resources for learning. First, I will consider the basic principles of The Art of Learning, then I will apply DiSSS and CaFE from 4-hour Chef to figure out how to attack the learning or this instrument. The principles of the art of learning:

1.  _Enjoy the process_. If it is not being enjoyed, it's time to review.
2.  _Master the fundamentals_. As temping as I might be, I will not rush into more advanced exercises, or increases the tempo of my practice until I am certain that I am ready.
3.  _Enter the soft zone of quiet intense focus_. 10 minutes of focused practice is better than 1 hour of unfocused practice.
4.  _Get comfortable being uncomfortable_. Don't remove distractions. Seek out challenges. Play to an audience whenever the opportunity presents itself.
5.  R_eset the mind after a series of errors_.
    1.  take deep breaths
    2.  splash water on your face
    3.  do a quick sprint (which gives a physiological flush)
6.  _Nurture your talents._
7.  _Push yourself_. Seek out other musicians to jam with, especially musicians who are more skilled.
8.  _Minimise repetition of mistakes._ Remember to check often that the correct technique is being used.
9.  _Invest in loss_. Mistakes are the best teachers, don't let fear of making then stop a performance.
10.  _Allow protected periods for cultivation_. Sometimes you get worse while you internalise skills before you get better.
11.  _Depth over breadth_. Don't take on too much at once. Detailed knowledge of a few areas is far better than vague knowledge of many.
12.  _Make smaller circles._ practice techniques slowly at first, then , once successful, refine them while keeping their essence.
13.  Become inspired by setbacks. Figure out how you can practice around injuries or other "disadvantages".
14.  _Search for the zone_. Let the mind recover after intense focus. Try quick sprints, deep breaths, etc.
15.  _Listen to fear_. The things we don't want to do (or practice) are the things we should.

DiSSS & CaFE **Deconstruction**: Tabla is a type Indian drum set which has been played mostly in Northern India for over 1000 years. It consists of two drums, the larger ____ on the left and the ____ on the right. The ____ (larger drum) has over 6 different sounds each produced by a different technique: - - - The ____ (smaller drum) has over 8 different sounds / techniques: - Ta / Na - - There is another set of techniques that are combinations of the techniques above played at the same time: - Dha - - The tabla is used in many different Indian traditional rhythms called _bole_. They usually consist of 8, 12, or 16 beats that can be thought of a 2, 3, or 4 bars of 4/4 time. Each bole consists of many different variation (¿10+?). ¿These are played interchangeably throughout the song? Here are some common bole. What is the composition? Answers from interview with Bablu: See also the TFX about learning the drums. **Selection**: From what I've seen ta/na, tin (what lalait showed me), te (muted strike) on the ____ (smaller drum) and ¿ge / ke?, and ¿te? on the left (larger drum) make up 80% of what's played. From my lesson with Lalait and BNU (or VNU - Varanasi university) tin should be learned before ta to develop proper technique. The ____ technique is similar to a djembe technique and may be able to be picked up quickly. ___(¿te? And ___ the muted strikes) seem to be the least technical and easiest to learn. Given the above, I will focus on learning the following techniques first: -te -tin - Bole Many different bole, exercises, and techniques exist. I will focus on those using the above techniques, like the one taught to me by Lalait. INSERT VIDEO. In the beginning I will also substitute tin for ta where ever it is found until I feel more comfortable with the technique. Need to find more bole to practice. **Steaks**: Creating steaks or consequences for not completing your goals is the easiest step to complete and also the easiest step to skip. It's so easy tell yourself that you don't need to do this, but skipping this step is a huge mistake. Sometimes a public announcement like this blog post is enough. Sometimes you need help from stickk.com. As I learned from Zen Habits, the secret to developing a habit is to mentally commit to a small goal (I started flossing my committing to floss at least 1 tooth each day). That's why I am commit to practicing the tabla 10 minutes each day. I know that in reality I will practice more. Most days it will be 20-30, and I will practice in my down time - on trains, waiting for people, and on walking tours that turn out to be not so interesting, etc. But ok those days when I am tired, or sick of playing the tabla and feeling like ok not making progress, a 10 minute practice session will help me keep my habit and won't break my spirit. I will use the Lift app to track this help me commit. **Compression**: Techniques: [See selection] Practice:

You say, 'I'm going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid. You do that every single day. And soon you have a wall." -- Will Smith

*enter the zone* ¿through meditation? For each technique, bole, and exercise: Set metronome to a slow pace eg 60, and strike the drum every second beat. Adopt correct posture: -Staight back -Relax shoulders -Elbows in -Straight wrists -Thumbs touching index finger lightly Practice the technique for at least 20 repetitions. Create PDF for compression **Frequency**: Frequent regular practice is best. Every day is good, twice daily is better. **Encoding**: Saying the names of the strikes as they are played helps to internalise and associate them.
