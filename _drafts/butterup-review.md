The best fatty spread is not a blend of butter and vegetable oil, or olive oil that's been chemically enhanced to be a solid a room temperature. The best deliciousness that was designed to be put in between bread a Vegemite is 100% pure butter. The problem is that in Australia, butter must be kept in the fridge, and when it's cold, it's not exactly spreadable. Enter ButterUp.

[ButterUp](http://www.butterup.com.au/) is a specialist butter knife that I funded on Kickstarter a while back. I funded it because I think it's a great idea. The problem is that their execution is sub-par. Luckily its salvageable.

## The Problems

1. Serration
2. blade is too thick and food gets stuck in the holes.

## The Fix

Have your knife sharpening man remove the seration (but don't turn it into a sharp knife), and thin the blade out where the holes are. Done. If the guys at ButterUp would kindly do this I would be happy to recommend their product. Until then, if you're thinking of buying one, factor this into the cost.
