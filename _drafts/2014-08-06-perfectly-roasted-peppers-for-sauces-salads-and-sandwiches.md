The skin of the capsicum, just like the skin of the tomato, is a horrible beast that can ruin an otherwise good dish. Think about a delicious stew, bolognaise, or ratatouille that has been cooking away for a good amount of time and developing some nice flavours. The aroma fills the air like thick fog and you start to get excited. When you finally get the first spoonful in your mouth, it easily breaks apart between your teeth. All except one part - the skins of the tomatoes and peppers that have come off the flesh and rolled up into tasteless, indestructible little pieces of plastic. It's a good way to ruin a perfectly good meal. The solution is easy with tomatoes. You either cut a cross in the bottom, drop them into boiling water for 30-60s, into cold water to stop the cooking, then peel off the skin from the cross. Or, for smaller quantities, half them across the stem axis, grate the flesh and seeds discarding the left over skin. With capsicums it's a bit more tedious. You either have to reduce the cooking time so that the skin doesn't break away from the flesh, or you roast the capsicum and remove the skin yourself. [OR If you're going a stew, you have to either throw them in the simmering pot a bit later so that they don't cook for so long, which will keep the skins on. Or you roast them, remove the skin, and then add them late.] Most methods of roasting you will see are pretty standard. Cut them them up, put them on a tray, under the grill for a few minutes, then peel the skin off. For me this was never as easy as it sounded. Then I read somewhere that the secret was to put them into a ziplock bag for 5 minutes before peeling off the skin. This did seem to make the task easier, but I was already pushed to the limits of my efforts to roast them instead of just throwing them in. The ziplock bag was the straw that broke the camels back, or as they say in Spain, the drop that overflowed the glass. I experimented and found that you can get the same ziplock bag effect if you simply lay a sheet of cling wrap over the peppers after you take them out from under the grill. If you do this correctly, the skins should come off easily. See the pictures below. Here's the method: 
1. Cut the flesh off the capsicum and discard the seeds and stem. Try to keep the pieces as large, but as flat as you can. Larger pieces means less effort, but flat pieces mean even roasting.

2. lay the pieces of capsicum on a piece of aluminium foil on a baking tray and put under a hot grill. When the skins has bubbled / blackened across almost the whole surface, it's ready.

3. Take the aluminium sheet with the capsicum on top, lay in on the bench, place some cling film on top pressing it flat again the peppers and aluminium. Then place a tea towel over the whole thing and come back in 5 minutes or when you next get a spare moment.

4. Remove the tea towel and cling film. Pinch the capsicum skins close to one and peel them off.

They are now ready to use. Preserve them, blend them into a sauce, put them on sandwiches, in a salad, ratatouille, etc.
