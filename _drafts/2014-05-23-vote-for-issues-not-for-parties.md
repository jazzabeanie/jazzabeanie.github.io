- listen to the recording of my interview with Fiona of the Australian Sex Party and do a piece. 

A vote for a minor party aimed at a specific issue means a lot more than a vote for a major party. If you vote for the Australian Fishing Party, or the High Speed Rail Network for Australia party, you vote will be extrapolated to count for the opinions of hundreds of people. Opinion polls don't mean shit. They aren't an accurate sample. Opinions poll results represent the views of only people who take opinion polls, most of which (not all) are idiots.

If you vote for a major party, and they win, you're vote was wasted. If you didn't vote, they still would've won. The fact that you voted for them doesn't give then any indication of how to secure more votes.
If you vote for a major party and the opposition major party wins, that sucks for you, and you wasted your vote. When major parties look to secure more votes, they aim for people who are sitting on the fence, the don't look to convert the ever faithful. You don't see crazy street preachers yelling about Jesus in front of a mosque.
Who are the people sitting on the fence about their vote? The people who believe in an issue which isn't supported by any of the major parties.

Let's say that in the next election, major party 1 gets 37% of votes, major
party 2 gets 35% of votes and Australian Tits Out For The Boys Party get 10% of votes. I'd say there's a good chance that we'd see some relaxation in public nudity laws come into effect.
