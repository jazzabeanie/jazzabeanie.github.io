Don't use other forms of study as a way of avoiding speaking practice.  You need to find native French speakers and practice.  There are many ways to find French speakers:
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height:15px;">Couchsurfing</span></li>
	<li>http://www.franglish.eu/</li>
	<li>Move into a hostel</li>
	<li>Visit "Improve your English" classes</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

But before you do get out there are have conversations, it will be handy to know how to say a few things.  Firstly there are a few things that you will definitely need to know how to say:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height:15px;">how do you say ____?</span></li>
	<li>how do you spell it?</li>
	<li>can you repeat that please?</li>
	<li>I don't understand</li>
	<li>can you speak slower please?</li>
</ul>
Then there are the usual things that will come up when you first start talking to someone:
<ul>
	<li>I have been learning French since _____ days</li>
	<li>I am from _____</li>
	<li>I was born in ____</li>
	<li>I have ____ years (I am ___ years old)</li>
</ul>
Once you feel like you've exhausted all your introductory vocabulary, it's good to have a sentence up your sleeve that will take the conversation where you want it to go:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height:15px;">My vocabulary is limited, but I do know about family...</span></li>
</ul>
As you might guess, it's also good to know about family:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height:15px;">How many brothers/sisters do you have? How old is/are he/she/they?</span></li>
	<li>What is/are his/her/their name(s)?</li>
	<li>How old is your father/mother?</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
You should also know how to talk about your own family.
