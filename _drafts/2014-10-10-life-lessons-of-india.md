Paraphrasing Neil Strauss here, correcting a human behaviour or mindset is like trying to straighten a bent wire. You don't just push the wire straight again. You have to bend it back the other way before it will stay straight again. Traveling to India is like having your world view bent back the other way. It gives you a whole new perspective from which to look at the world, you life, and your beliefs. Here are the things that India taught me.

&nbsp;

<strong>You get used to being uncomfortable</strong>. And you get used to being comfortable. So in the end, what's the difference?

<strong>You will see the rediculousness of social norms</strong>. In India you will see how silly some aspects of our society really are when you are shown they same idea take a different form. What would be perceived as gay in other countries is totally acceptable in India. Also it's taboo to show legs in India, but not stomach.

I'm starting to wonder if eating pasture raised cows is more humane than letting them roam free. But ask an Indian person and they might say something else.

<strong>You will learn that that don't need to eat meat every single day</strong>. Until I went to India, logically I could acknowledge that we don't need meat every single day, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing if I went a whole day without ripping flesh from bone with my teeth like a real caveman on an escapade. When you first get to India you will be too scared to eat meat, and that's probably for the best until you let your body adjust. After a few days of vegetarian food and you will suddenly realise that you feel fine.

<strong>You will learn to stop being a clean freak</strong>. It is impossible to stay clean in India. If you have any form of obsession about eating or being clean you will either get over it, you'll go insane, or you'll die. The human immune system is remarkable and India will only make it even more so.

<strong>It will teach you to stand up for yourself</strong>. No one is going to help you. You need to push your way through traffic, to the front of the queue, through the doors of the train, etc.

<strong>It will teach you not to take everything so personally</strong>. If someone beeps their horn at you, it doesn't necessarily mean they think you're a dickhead. Don't take offense. You can barter a vendor down to 30% of the original price and there will not be sour afterwards.

<strong>It will teach you to be a better driver</strong>. Sometimes I feel like I would be safer if I was back in the chaotic streets of India. Statistics say otherwise, but I have a feeling that if Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner of Freakonomics were to look into this, we would see that it wasn't so black and white. In the west we have countless complex rules about who has right of way. This allows us to go faster and to blame someone when there is an accident. In India you quickly realise that the only real rule is the person in front has right of way, and even that is just a guideline. As a result you lean to expect anything. You drive slower. You pay attention constantly. You ignore other drivers indicator signals as they could mean anything.
A few years ago I was a passenger involved in a minor traffic collision. If any one of the three drivers involved in the accident were driving properly it would've been avoided. People are bound to break the rules of the road. There are too many of them, they are too complex, and we drive too much to be able to keep up the concentration. Traffic accidents occur when you assume that everyone else is going to follow the rules. No one assumes this in India because there are no rules.

<strong>It will teach you patience</strong>. Horrendous traffic jams, endless queues, and busses packed to double their capacity. When you leave India, you will always carry with you, the phrase, "I've had worse in India". But don't get me wrong, there are a lot of amazing things about India too. But this isn't that kind of blog.
