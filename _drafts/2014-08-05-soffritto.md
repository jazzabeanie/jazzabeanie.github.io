If you like to cook on the fly or change things up occasionally, you will gain much inspiration from understanding soffritto. Soffritto is the Italian name, but the concept is seen in all cuisines. Mirepoix in France, hogao in Columbia, refrito in Peru, the holy trinity in Louisiana, Kinpira in Japan, etc. The basic concept is to flavour fat with aromatic ingredients.

To see the most basic form of a Spanish sofrito, cook the recipe that follows. The quality of the tomatoes make a massive difference. IS IT WORTH IT TO COOK THIS IF YOU ONLY HAVE SHIT TOMATOES? CAN TIN TOMATOES BE SUBSTITUTED? You will be surprised at the flavour. Serves 1 person
<blockquote>In extra virgin olive oil: fry 2 cloves garlic (finely diced) ~ smelling good, ≈30 seconds. Add 1 large tomato (grated). Simmer ~ consistency of jam. Keep simmering ~ it darkens in colour (don't stray too far from the pan or it will burn). Serve spread over bread, or mixed through couscous or pasta. I FEEL HERBS WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT ADDITION AT THE END. MINT? PARSLEY?</blockquote>
This also goes very with rice. I like to make Arroz al horno with the garlic and the tomatoes done separately like the recipe above. The same idea can be simplified. In a cazuela de barro: fry some vegetables (even just onion), and if you want, brown some meat as well. Add some rice, and stock (twice the volume of the rice). Put in the 200C? oven until water has been soaked up and the rice is crisping 20-40 minutes depending on prefered level of crispness. The serve with the tomato based sauce poured on top.

***TEST: cook diced onions in oil, add tomatoes. cook diced onions in oil, drain the onions on a paper towel and wipe the pan clean of the oil. heat up tomato, add the onions, compare the two.

The secret knowledge for making a good sofrito is that you are infusing flavour into the fat. Don't skimp on the fat.
