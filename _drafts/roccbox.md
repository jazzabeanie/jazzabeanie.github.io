description: A collection of my favorite Roccbox recipes

These are my favorite things to make in the Roccbox:

- [Turkish Chese Pide](https://au.gozney.com/blogs/recipes/cheese-pide-recipe), however it's the concept of the pide that I like. Fill it with anything. Leave the oven on low and don't walk away until the pide is done.

These are some recipes that I want to try:

- Charred leeks from the [Turkish Chese Pide Recipe](https://au.gozney.com/blogs/recipes/cheese-pide-recipe), but served with salsa calçots. This might be the closest thing I will get to eating calçots outside of Cataluña.
