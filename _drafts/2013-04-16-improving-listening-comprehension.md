Same rules as for reading.  Watch youtube videos on your favourite subject.  Search "cuisiner" in youtube if you like cooking.  Watch french movies but be careful; English movies dubbed in French with French subtitles don't work.  French movies bought outside of France don't have French subtitles.  You need get a hold of French DVDs from France then you can watch them with the French subtitles {hopefully}.  Then you gotta get over the problem of dvd player regions.)

You can also watch french TV: http://www.canalplus.fr/

Listen to French radio.
