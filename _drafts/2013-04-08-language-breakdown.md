Tim Ferriss in the intro:
<ol>
	<li>The apple is red. <strong><em>La pomme est rouge.</em></strong></li>
	<li>It is John's apple. <em><strong>C'est la pomme de John.</strong></em><b><i> </i></b></li>
	<li>I give John the apple. <em><strong>Je donne la pomme à John.</strong></em><b><i> </i></b></li>
	<li>We give him the apple. <em><strong>Nous lui donnons la pomme.</strong></em></li>
	<li>He gives it to John. <em><strong>Il la donne à John.</strong></em></li>
	<li>She gives it to him. <em><strong>Elle la lui donne.</strong></em></li>
	<li>The red apples are John's. <strong>Les pommes rouges sont à John.</strong></li>
</ol>
From these sentences we can see that French is just like English in that the structure is subject-verb-object (eg, The Apple is Red).  The tricky part is that French puts pronouns before the verb where in English, pronouns go after (eg, He gives <strong><span style="color:#0101df;">it</span></strong> to John - <em>Il <strong><span style="color:#0101df;">la</span></strong> donne à John. And also, We give <strong><span style="color:#0101df;">him</span></strong> the apple. <em>Nous <strong><span style="color:#0101df;">lui</span></strong> donnons la pomme.</em></em>)

We can also see from sentences 4 and 5, that the verb (donner, which means to give) is conjugated differently depending on who is doing the giving.

I give - je donne
You give - tu donnes
We give - nous donnons
etc

Luckily, in French like in English, the giver is specified before the verb (Je for I, tu for you, and nous for we).  These little words are called a <a title="http://french.about.com/od/grammar/ss/subjectpronouns.htm" href="http://french.about.com/od/grammar/ss/subjectpronouns.htm">subject pronouns</a>.  This means that we don't have to memorise loads of different conjugations to get reading comprehension (like in Spanish, for example).

In sentence 7, we see that the adjective has to agree with the noun in number (and also in gender).  Also, we see that the adjective comes after the noun (eg, red apples vs pommes rouges).  This isn't always the case in french, but you'll pick that up as times goes on.

This will reduce time to comprehension.  You will be reading in no time.
