1200 words in 30 days is my aim.  I've heard that that is the number of words needed to be conversationally fluent.  After that I will aim for 3000 which is the number required to read most newspapers.  It makes sense to start with the most common and then prioritise the words based on what I am reading.

There is a great website called <a title="Memrise" href="http://www.memrise.com" target="_blank">Memrise</a>.  This website was created by Ed Cooke (A <a title="Grand Master of Memory" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Master_of_Memory" target="_blank">Grand Master of Memory</a>) and Greg Detre (Princeton neuroscientist specializing in the science of memory and forgetting).  These guys have incorporated a lot of things into the learning process that have been proven to benefit the learner.  The review sessions are spaced at the most efficient periods, the mnemonics used to remember words include images (which is proven to enhance memory strength), and are based off results of other students.  Plus you can create your own if you feel it would suit you better.  I did find some problems with the site<sup>1</sup>, but nothing that couldn't be overcome.

I logged onto Memrise with my facebook account and started leraning within 30 seconds.  I picked a <a title="Minimum Viable French" href="http://www.memrise.com/course/47/minimum-viable-french/" target="_blank"><em>Minimum Viable French</em></a> course.  This course contains 307 words and I assume that they are among the most commonly used.  Once I learned these I started the <a title="450 Most Common Verbs" href="http://www.memrise.com/course/2086/450-most-common-french-verbs/" target="_blank">450 Most Common Verbs</a> course.  While studying these, I kept a note on my phone of any words I came across in speaking or reading practice that I didn't know.  I then transferred these words to the <a title="Genius" href="http://genius.en.softonic.com/mac" target="_blank">Genius</a> program and learnt them (I never tried it myself, but windows users could try <a title="Anki" href="http://ankisrs.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a>).

1. I found that when reviewing words, I often made small errors - like translating in a different way, or making a typo - that caused be to be wrong.  Even though I knew the word or the phrase, the software though I didn't and made me review the word more often which slowed down my learning time.  I eventually chose to ignore words in the setting once I was sure that I knew them.
