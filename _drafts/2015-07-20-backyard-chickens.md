What am I trying to say?

Warn the reader that the chickens will die in the end.

I could feel my armpits dampen as I drove along the Ipswich Motorway. Despite the warm weather my windows were up and my aircon was off. The only thing I thought I knew about baby chickens at this point was that they should be kept at around 35ºC. At that moment there were two baby chickens happily chirping away in a cardboard box on the back seat of my car, which is why I was sweating profusely. Sometimes sacrifices must be made in the pursuit of culinary perfection.

In an effort to stop myself getting emotionally attached to my chickens, I christened them <em>Paella</em> and <em>Roast</em>. Even so, this was not an easy task. I had to restrain myself from petting them, from playing with them, and from thinking about how cute they were. My chickens were not my friends. I was lucky to have happened apon chicks that were 1-2 weeks old -- verging on adolescence. I wasn't their friend either.

A few hours earlier, when I knew that I had everything I needed - a decent sized cardboard box, a heat generating desk lamp, a feed tray, and a water dish - I headed straight for <a href="http://www.heritagehatchingandhens.com.au/">Heritage Hatching and Hens</a>. At the farm I was told that the chickens needed to be kept under a heat lamp until they were 6 weeks old. $20 was enough to get me two of their gourmet meat chickens and enough starter feed to last 6 weeks. That gave me plenty of time to figure out what to do with them after they got too big for the cardboard box.

It didn't take the cheeky little chickens long to figure out that they could jump up on the edge of the box, down to the living room floor, and shit over everything. A fine mesh that let in air and light but stopped escaping chickens solved that problem. Lining the bottom of the box with newspaper and changing it at least twice daily helped to keep it clean.

A week later they were eating and pooing more than every so I upgraded to a bigger box, and a bigger feed dish.

A week after that I set up a rough temporary enclosure in the back yard. 4 posts surrounded by some chicken wire and a sheet of corrugated iron on top. Initially I didn't bother with the corrugated iron but noisy miner birds were swooping  and butcher birds were eying them off and licking their chops. I let the chickens run around outside during the day and brought them in under the light at night.

At 6 weeks old I removed the heat lamp but continued to keep the chickens inside at night. Apparently they are still quite vulnerable to cold snaps so better to keep them warm until 8 weeks.

With the chicken quickly growing and me getting sick of changing the newspaper in the bottom of their box, I needed to get a start on the coop. To me the most important attribute of a hen house is that it is low maintenance. To quote a friend of mine, "Steal the tallest parking cone you can from a road works site and string it upside down pointing into a bucket. This should hold about 10kg of lay mash + you'll only have to feed the pricks every few weeks." While I don't fancy myself much of a thief, I did like the idea of a feeding system that didn't require constant monitoring.

In fact, I'd like to keep all monitoring to a minimum. The less time I have to spend raising chickens, the more I can spend eating them. Getting down on my hands and knees and scrubbing chicken poo off  timber floor boards doesn't seem very appealing to me. To get around this I have two options. 1 - get a chicken tractor that can easily be moved onto new ground, or 2 - have fixed housing with flooring that can easily be hosed out.

I chose the tractor method as it seems like less effort to set up, and I don't have to worry about predators digging in because my property fence will take care of them. I wasn't quite sure about how to deal with vermin, when I came up with my design, but I would worry about that later. I jumped on Google's free drawing program, SketchUp, and came up with the following rough plan.

<a href="http://www.cavemanescapades.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Chicken-Coop-Drawing.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1671" src="http://www.cavemanescapades.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Chicken-Coop-Drawing.jpg" alt="Chicken Coop Drawing" width="671" height="584" /></a>

Even from a few weeks old my chickens started developing personalities. Paella was docile and dopey. Roast was flighty, vocal, and a massive ratbag. Paella was always bigger, and she developed a pink comb and wattles that would wobble with her erratic movements. Despite her smaller size, felt like Roast was the boss. If a bug was found amongst the grass it was Roast that usually ended up eating it, and she was pushy about what position she wanted on the roost.

I wanted to give my chickens more time to explore, and scratch about the yard. I opened their enclosure and let them roam while I was working nearby. I couldn't stray too far, because I had to make sure my dog Pepper was staying vigilant, watching for aggressive and predatory birds. Pepper was a good companion for Roast and Paella. She would sunbake near their favourite dust bowl and they never took any notice of her inquisitive nose.

After setting them loose in the back yard, I soon discovered that my fantasy of my chickens tending to the garden pests was not going to come true. They tended to miss the bugs eating my lettuce leaves, and instead chose to scratch away the mulch and go for the beneficial earthworms in the soil. When Pepper and I chased them out of the garden bed, they would head straight for my styrofoam pot plants and peck holes in them. I'm sure that Roast was the instigator of all this. She was always the first one to start trouble.

It was obvious that if my chickens were to be free range, they would need to learn to fend for themselves. At around 9 weeks old, I had left them roaming the garden while I was close by making sure they didn't get into mischief. They were happily lying in their favourite pile of dirt, soaking up the winter sun. I heard the characteristic aggressive yip of the noisy miner bird and looked up to see my chickens looking startled with the heads high in the air. The minor bird swooped a second and by the third, paella had gotten to her feet. She met the noisy miner's fourth swoop with a charge of her own that sent the smaller bird quietly sulking off to feel sorry for itself.

Whenever I wanted to get the chickens back into their temporary coop I called on Pepper. Her instinct to herd is quite strong - when we would take her to the dog park she would round all the other dogs in to a corner of the park - but she wouldn't always herd the chickens where I wanted them to go. She was always interested in the chickens, but she knew she wasn't allowed to touch them. Despite the photo below, I always felt I could trust her to be alone with them.

After 9 weeks, when I was running out of my second batch of chick starter feed, I decided to start them on kitchen food scraps. I threw a few vegetable scraps into their coop and watched as they took a single peck and went back to their chick starter. I thought that the it might have been because the scraps were in large pieces, so the next day I chopped the vegetable scraps into little pieces - like a mother mushing up fruit for a young baby. But the fussy chickens still preferred the chick starter, or pecking at grass. Like most children who refuse to eat their vegetables, when the alternative is going hungry, they eventually come to their senses.

After Paella and Roast finished the last of their chick starter, I went down to Rochedale Produce[LINK] to pick up some more chicken feed. I passed the point-of-lay hens that were selling for $20 each, when it occurred to me - that's not much more than I would pay for an whole organic chicken at a fancy butcher. $46 later I walked out with 20kg of feed and a black hen which I decided to call Practice.

Pulling out onto the service road, I remember that chicken feed wasn't the only reason that I'd left the house. I also needed to buy a new jumper. Hearing Practice clucking away on the seat beside me, I realised that if I took her to the shops with me it would probably end up something like that scene from Borat.

I was wrong. Practice waited quietly while I walked around the shops trying on sweaters. I was having second thoughts already. How could I kill such a respectful chicken?

I put her in the coop with Paella and Roast. They were a bit wary of her, and since she was slightly bigger, they didn't bully her as has been known to happen.

The following day, I took her over to my brother's house. With a few friends, we spent the afternoon researching and preparing. As we were trying to figure out the best way for a quick and endless death, it occurred to me how smooth and shiny her feathers were. It felt quite nice to run my hand over her back. I decided to leave the lid of her box slightly ajar to at least give her a small chance of escape. I felt like Dr Evil.

There is a lot of advice out there on how to kill and prepare a chicken, but I found none that I would call comprehensive. We cut off the top of a traffic cone so that there was a 10cm hole. We put Practice into the hole head first, and hung the cone up from a double sided ladder. My brother held her head in his left hand, and a sharp chef's knife in his right hand. With a firm grip and a quick movement, the head was completely severed. In less than a second, it was done. We stood there in silence for about 20 seconds.

It was finally broken when my brother's broke into spontaneous song, "It's the circle of life!". We all burst out laughing. After the initial shock, it really wasn't that bad. If my life ended that quickly, I'd be quite relieved if I wasn't dead. Better than being boiled alive like a lobster, that's for sure.

plucking, &amp; gutting

Paella and Roast continued to get bigger and bigger. One time I saw them attacking minor birds that were trying to get to the bread that I'd thrown them.

Once they found the compost heap they were in heaven. They would scratch around in the decomposing soil pecking at worms and bugs all day. Then they would lethargically make their way up to the lawn, where they would sunbath in their favourite dust bowl, their crops bulging.

Unsatisfied with the grown rate of Paella and Roast, I headed back to <a href="http://www.heritagehatchingandhens.com.au/">Heritage Hatching and Hens</a>. I knew that I wanted some chickens that actually laid eggs. Maybe they could lay for me for a few months before I turned them into Chicken Benedict. When I arrived at Heritage Hatching and Hens, the carpark was full. There were lots of families there to get feed for their little chickens. When it was my turn, I told the farmer what I wanted and we discussed my options. I thanked him for his good advice, to which he replied, "It's nice to be able to talk honestly for a change".

I took two plump brown laying hens home, christened them Breakfast and Brunch, and put them in the cage. Paella and Roast were out scratching about in the yard at this point. My egg layers were between 4 and 6 months old, and so a little bigger than my barely 3 month old meat chickens. When the sun began to set, I rounded up Paella and Roast and put them in their cage with the two older chickens.

After a few moments of confusion, Breakfast began to cluck quite loudly. It seemed to me like she was claiming her territory, and establishing herself at the top of the pecking order. The two young ones were desperately searching the front of the cage looking for a way out. When they realised it was futile, they made straight for their usual perch at the top of the cage. Breakfast took the third spot on the top perch, and Brunch had to settle for a lower shelf.

The first thing the older egg layers did upon being released into the yard a few days later, was demonstrate to my young meat chickens that my temporary enclosure fence was far too low. Before long Paella was also attempting to escape to cause a mess in my garden. I trimmed all of their wings, repurposed the fence to keep the chickens out of my garden and gave them full reign of the yard. Paella and Roast snuck off to the compost bins before Breakfast or Brunch had even realised that they had gone. They weren't sharing their secret spot.

Breakfast did eventually find the compost heap and soon become friendly with Paella and Roast, although it was obvious that they were a clique not easily infiltrated. For some reason, Brunch just wasn't fitting in. She didn't sleep with the others, and she didn't leave her 3m radius comfort zone around the cage during the day time. She was even more wary of me than Roast was, which is quite a statement.

Find more symptoms and pose the above questions to /r/chickens.

Breakfast on the other hand was really quite friendly. She liked to near me. Sometimes she would follow me around the yard. Though she never liked to be touched, she had a very strange behaviour when I went to pick her up. Rather than scrambling like the other, she would perform what I can only describe as a shuffle squat. She would quickly shift her weight from left foot to right foot and back, while lowering her center of gravity and spreading her wings slightly. It was very convenient not to have to chase her.

I wish I could tell you that Paella turned out to make a delicious paella, and that the meat was full of flavour, better than any chicken I'd ever had, but I can't. If you want that information, you'll have to ask my neighbours dogs.

After Paella had gone, Roast found herself at the bottom of the pecking order with no friends. She was too small to eat, so I decided to make a Paella with Brunch (who has time for brunch anyway), and let Breakfast keep Roast company until she was nice a plump.

Brunch was the first animal I have killed and it wasn't a very nice feeling. When all was done, I was left with a semi-consoling thought - at least she didn't get eaten alive by a pack of  domesticated wolves.

Have I said it?
