The French language has A LOT of words.  It's impossible to say exactly how many, but I think we can all agree that there are too many to try and learn them from A-Z.  The trick is to start with the most common.  Start with the most common 300 words.  You can learn this in a just over a week if you learn 40 words a day and it will cover around 70% of the words used. Time to start reading... almost.

Need to learn collocations; not just common words but words which go together commonly, like prendre un cafe or faire un rendez-vous

Even when you 70% of the words on a page, reading will be difficult, slow, and frustrating.  This is the point that you are most likely to throw in the towel.  Luckily there are a few things we can do to minimise that chance:

1. <strong>Read something with pictures.</strong>  Graphic novels and comics are fantastic right now.  With the help of the pictures, you will only have to look up a few words to get the gist of what is going on.

2. <strong>Read something with a specific vocabulary.</strong>  The most specific the subject of the reading material, the more often the same words come up.  Write a list of words as the come up, then put these into your word learning software (I use <a title="http://genius.en.softonic.com/mac" href="http://genius.en.softonic.com/mac">Genius</a>).  Learn these words with the software and your reading material will become a lot easier.

3. <strong>Make the content interesting to you.</strong>  If you like fighting read fighting manuals, if you like cooking read recipes (check out <a title="http://www.marmiton.org/" href="http://www.marmiton.org/">Marmiton</a>), if you like sex read erroitca.  The challenging thing will be to find these things.  You may need the help of a native speaker<sup>1</sup>.

4. <strong>Read something that is easy.</strong>  To start with, easier is better.  At this point we need to build some confidence.  Content aimed at children is perfect.

In my attempt to find something to read, I went for a trip to the library.  Luckily, in Edinburgh there is a children's library and it was there that I found 4 episodes of Tin Tin in French.  When I got home I found that although Tin Tin is awesome, it's not the best for someone just starting to learn.

Notes:
1. You will need the help of native speakers eventually when learning a language.  I will cover this topic later, but for now I'm sure you can use your imagination to come up with a way to find them.
