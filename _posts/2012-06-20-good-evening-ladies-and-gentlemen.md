This is a blog that we have set up in an attempt to document our adventures somewhat and to make all the people back home real jelly.  On the 2nd of July 2012 we will be leaving Brisbane, Australia for Europe for an indefinite period.  We've got tickets, VISAs, and big plans.  Stay tuned for more information.
