A molcajete is basically a big pestle and mortar. This is a why it's so good:

Pro tip - [use the freezer](https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/06/freeze-basil-leaves-for-food-processor-pesto-curry-paste.html).

Cleaning:
- [some people](https://youtube.com/shorts/6FmN4RvuI0Y?si=mHtFEQErqDkLtVYQ) will grind rice every te they clean it. I'm not doing that.
- [this lady is super annoying, but worth a watch](https://youtube.com/shorts/T4FGHVaKDsM?si=J0-aG1pv6VwRgNBx)
- [good and simple process](https://youtu.be/Hm01jZMLdwk?si=fd3fAv3NayX9qgwg)

I have a sprinkler on my hose with a relatively high pressure spray setting. I will use this, maybe grind some salt too, and then leave it somewhere it will get direct sunlight in the morning.
