A big part of our plans for this trip revolve around us busking. While Rob has busked many times, I have never actually done it, so a few months back I decided to give it a shot for some experience. The rage comic below shows what happened.

Despite my warm welcome, I went on to make $6 that night. 1 from a girl who recognised me from somewhere else, and 5 from a guy who I befriended while his drunk mate tried to play some Led Zeppelin on my ukulele.

I think I'll just learn on the job.
