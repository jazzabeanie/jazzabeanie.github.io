These are my favorite things to make in the Roccbox

Turkish Chese Pide
------------------



Unfortunately [the recipe](https://au.gozney.com/blogs/recipes/cheese-pide-recipe) has changed, but the original is still on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjs3n3UDcAw&t=199s). The concept (which is what I like most) is to make a bread pocket, and fill it with anything. Leave the oven on low and don't walk away until the pide is done. In the original video I think she fills the pide with charred leek and a chese sauce. It's very nice.

Dough ingredients:

- 100% flour
- 56% water
- 1.1% yeast
- 2% olive oil
- 2% salt
- 2% sugar

I find that balls of 80g work best, which equates to about 50g of flour per pide.

These are some recipes that I want to try:

- Charred leeks from the [Turkish Chese Pide Recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjs3n3UDcAw&t=199s), but served with salsa calçots. This might be the closest thing I will get to eating calçots outside of Cataluña.
- [Lahmacun - Turkish Pizza](https://au.gozney.com/blogs/recipes/lahmacun-turkish-pizza-recipe?switcher=true) (see also [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNskskqzqEM))
- [Cheesy Pizza Bites](https://au.gozney.com/blogs/recipes/cheesy-pizza-bites-recipe)
- [Beef short Rib & mushrooms](https://au.gozney.com/blogs/recipes/beef-short-ribs-and-wild-mushrooms) | [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oq5NpShiM1U)
- finish some mostly boiled and squished potatoes or sweet potatoes
