These are my favorite things to make in the Roccbox

Turkish Chese Pide
------------------



[The official recipe](https://au.gozney.com/blogs/recipes/cheese-pide-recipe) is very good, however it's the concept of the pide that I like. Fill it with anything. Leave the oven on low and don't walk away until the pide is done.

Dough ingredients:

- 100% flour
- 56% water
- 0.7% yeast
- 2% olive oil
- 2% salt
- 2% sugar

I find that balls of 80g work best, which equates to about 50g of flour per pide.

These are some recipes that I want to try:

- Charred leeks from the [Turkish Chese Pide Recipe](https://au.gozney.com/blogs/recipes/cheese-pide-recipe), but served with salsa calçots. This might be the closest thing I will get to eating calçots outside of Cataluña.
- [Lahmacun - Turkish Pizza](https://au.gozney.com/blogs/recipes/lahmacun-turkish-pizza-recipe?switcher=true) (see also [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNskskqzqEM))
