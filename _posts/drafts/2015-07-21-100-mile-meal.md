Possible Ingredients: 100 miles = 160km Olive, 150km (by roads): http://www.rashvalleyolives.com.au/ Macadamia oil & macadamia nuts, (this is further by road, but might be within the radius as the crow flies, http://barenuts.com.au/ Prawns, caught behind Stradbroke Island. Can buy them directly off the trawler in Southport. Can get lots of fish here too, plus crabs, etc. Chickweed, foraged in the back yard. Sow Thistle, foraged in the back yard. Herbs, grown in the garden Garlic ??? Possible supplier: http://www.nscf.org.au/ Olive oil: http://www.coolanaolives.com.au/index.html or http://rathlogangrove.com.au/ Possible dishes: gambas al pil pil - need to find local garlic first. There is garlic growing in the back yard, but I'd prefer not to wait.   See email from Food Connect: Gidday Jared,

<div>For Garlic I would recommend Luke Stacey at Naturaleza farm in the Mary Valley [http://www.<wbr>naturalezafarm.com.au/garlic](http://www.naturalezafarm.com.au/garlic)</div>

<div>For Parsley, we currently get some from Debbie at Woggoon Farm  in the Samford Valley (find her on Instagram or at Samford Markets), and also from Ray and Merilyn Clark at Woombye (sell at the Big Pineapple Markets).  Both of these are small growers of herbs but sell at Farmers markets in their area.</div>

<div>You will find local Garlic mostly out of stock right now until the new season starts in October/November.</div>

<div>Of course anyone in the local area can source via Food Connect, retail or wholesale, although some of our produce comes from beyond 100miles, all the way up to 300miles.</div>

<div>Cheers, hope this helps.
