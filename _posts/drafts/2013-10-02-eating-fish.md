I'm in a moral quandary at the moment. One one I want to eat more fish because I don't think they'll be around forever and I want to get it while I can. On the other hand I think there might still be a chance of saving the little bastards and eating them seems counter productive to that. 

The reason I'm concerned that I won't be able to eat fish in the future is due to 3 things;
Dwindling fish numbers, ocean acidification, and Fukushima.

I've now realised that if everyone that cares about conserving the fish stocks of the ocean stops eating fish all together, then the demand for sustainable fishing industries will go away. That means that any fishermen still in the game will not be able to compete, and will go back to fishing unsustainable. Or will that extra demand on the oceans go away?
