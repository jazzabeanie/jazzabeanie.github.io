I just started watching a lecture on Fructose by ???

Something really interesting he said was:

LDL (a type of cholesterol) was discovered in 1970\. In mid 70's scientists discovered that dietary fat raises LDL levels in the blood. Then in the late 70's they found a correlation between levels of LDL and rates of heart disease. Then the USDA and other nutritionists made the conclusion that LDL lead to heart disease.

They we've got the 7 countries study which was front page of Time magazine in 1980\.  Here's a graph from the study:

These are some of the reasons why so many people people think that eating fat makes you fat.  But just because there is a correlation in data, doesn't mean that one causes the other.  In this video ?? goes on to make a very convincing argument that the cause of heart disease is fructose, not dietary fat.

Even though all the new evidence coming out is pointing to dietary fat (except trans fat) being good, I think that people are either unaware of it, or subconciously they don't believe it.  When I go to the supermarket, I see more low fat yoghurt than full fat.  I see just as much skim milk as full fat milk.  I went to Sainsbury the other day and could only find reduced fat crème fraîche.  They didn't even have the tastey version.  When I see "low fat" on the label of food it makes me laugh.  It's labeling food as "low in vitamins" as if it were a good thing.

Put aside the fact that fat is actually good for you and that you want it in your diet, if yogurt is low in fat, then it either;

*   tastes bad;
*   has no calories and you'll be hungry again in no time; or
*   compensates by adding sugar.
