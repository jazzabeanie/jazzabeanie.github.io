The **potato** is a [starchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch "Starch"), [tuberous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuber "Tuber") [crop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop "Crop") from the [perennial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_plant "Perennial plant") [nightshade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanaceae "Solanaceae") _[Solanum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanum "Solanum") tuberosum_ L. The word "potato" may refer either to the plant itself or the edible tuber. -Wikipedia 

**Starch** or **amylum** is a [carbohydrate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate "Carbohydrate") consisting of a large number of [glucose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose "Glucose") units joined by [glycosidic bonds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosidic_bond "Glycosidic bond"). -Wikipedia 

**Tubers** are various types of modified plant structures that are enlarged to store [nutrients](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient "Nutrient"). They are used by [plants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant "Plant") to survive the winter or dry months, to provide energy and nutrients for regrowth during the next growing season, and as a means of [asexual reproduction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual_reproduction "Asexual reproduction").<sup id="cite_ref-rooting_cuttings_of_tropical_trees_1-0" class="reference">[[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuber#cite_note-rooting_cuttings_of_tropical_trees-1)</sup> -Wikipedia 

The potato is a humble being, yet it has been the source of much confusion to me for many years. Why are some varieties better suited for certain serving methods? Is there any nutritional benefit to eating them? What was the secret to roast potatoes that everyone over the age of 40 seems to know? 

I once met someone who believed that a potatoes was a waste of space. Basically that it gave no benefits. Anyone who's eaten potatoes knows that this is obviously not true. They are at least beneficial in having the potential to provide a delicious eating experience, and that to me is enough to justify eating them. But for some people that just isn't enough. 

Looking at the [nutritional information](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2770/2) for a baked potato INCLUDING THE SKIN, we can see that it is a good source of carbohydrates, energy, high quality protein, fiber, vitamin C, vitamin B6, potassium, and manganese. It's also got a lot of other good stuff<sup>[[ref](http://www.drfranklipman.com/are-potatoes-that-bad/)]</sup>. It's not all fun and games though. In 2014, the average potato had more pesticides by weight than any other food<sup>[[ref](http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/summary.php)]</sup>. See [here](http://www.whatsonmyfood.org/food.jsp?food=PO) for a breakdown of pesticides found on potatoes, the chance of exposure, and the effects. If you're going to buy anything organic, potatoes could be the one. The thing is that finding organic potatoes in the supermarket is about as common as eating KFC and feeling good about it afterwards. 

Some people will also talk about potatoes making you fat and throw around words like blood sugar, insulin, and high GI. Then you'll hear the other side of the argument with words like, potato variety, Satiety Index, food pairing, and Mexican Pima Indians<sup>[[ref](http://www.drfranklipman.com/are-potatoes-that-bad/), [ref](http://foodandhealth.com/cpecourses/giobesity.php), [ref](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Jungle-Effect-Healthiest-Around/dp/0060886234)]</sup>. I believe that if you're worried about your weight, there are plenty of other things you should cut from your diet before potatoes, (start with sugar). READ THE JUNGLE EFFECT TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. 

One of the interesting things about potatoes is that they must be cooked before eating. Cooking breaks down the cellulose (fibre) that traps the starch (carbohydrates / energy)<sup>[[ref](http://www.cooks.com/rec/story/80/)]</sup>. 

[![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Potato_-_Amyloplasts.jpg/200px-Potato_-_Amyloplasts.jpg)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Potato_-_Amyloplasts.jpg) 

The above image<sup>[[ref](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_starch)]</sup> shows a potato cell (the polygon) and the round starch containing organelles (basically defined as a subunit within a cell) inside the potato cell. The higher the density of the starch organelles, the more the potato variety is considered high-starch. You can get an indication of the starch content of a potato when you cut into it. If the potato sticks to your knife, or it leaves a lot of white slimey moisture on the knife, it it more of a starchy potato. 

When you cook a potato the starch granules swell and burst weakening the structure. So the more starch a potato has, the fluffier it will be, and the more easily it will fall apart once cook. That is why you should choose high starch potatoes for making mash, or french fries/chips with a fluffy interior if that's the way you like them. High starch potatoes are referred to as "floury", or "starchy" or, "ideal for baking and mashing". On the other hand, low starch potatoes hold their shape better, making them ideal for stews, and salads. These are sometimes referred to as "waxy". 

This brings me to a major variable to play with when cooking - potato variety. Each potato variety has a slightly different composition of nutrients, hence different taste and different starch levels. It's very tempting to always go for the all purpose potatoes but a specialist might help you get the texture you're after. 
There are other variables you could play with when cooking potatoes: salt the water that they are boiled it? peel the potatoes before boiling or after? start from cold water or boiling? soak/rinse to remove surface starch? butter / milk / cream / olive oil / other shit? mash with what? 

From my experience cooking mash potatoes, I've noticed that the variable that has the biggest effect is the amount of butter added. The more butter, the better it is. I know what you're thinking. And I don't want a heart attack either. Luckily for us, a meta-analysis of prospective epidemiologic studies showed that there is no significant evidence for concluding that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease or cardiovascular disease<sup>[[ref](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/early/2010/01/13/ajcn.2009.27725.abstract)]</sup>. In fact, it might actually be that more saturated fat in your diet is beneficial. FIND REFERENCE TO STUDY. Still not sure? check out [this video of Dave Asprey eating butter and talking about the benefits](https://vimeo.com/50667879). "Yeah but, I don't want to get fat". If you're trying to lose weight, you should add more butter and less potato. Here are [23 studies](http://authoritynutrition.com/23-studies-on-low-carb-and-low-fat-diets/) that agree. 

THE MAN WHO ATE EVERYTHING HAS AN EXCELLENT CHAPTER ON POTATOES. 

THE ABOVE SECTION NEEDS MORE WORK. Do a test by cooking opposite varieties the same way and seeing if you can pick out the different ones. 

There is an great recipe for hashbrowns on Evernote. 

This pages compares nutritional value of sweet potatoes and normal potatoes and finds not too much difference. http://ancestralchef.com/why-arent-potatoes-paleo/ 

But, as Tim Ferriss says, the longest living Japanese people tend to have sweet potatoes rather than rice with meals. But this could just be due to a lack of rice or a million other factors rather than a presence of sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes also contain zero saponins (but this may not even be an issue, especially if you feel them). http://www.liveto110.com/potatoes-are-so-paleo/ 

WHAT ABOUT ROAST/BAKED POTATO??? - high starch for fluffyness. The secret is in 2 or 3 times cooked potatoes from hestons cookbook, or from chefsteps. 

boil potatoes in salted water? why? how much salt? 

soak to remove surface starch? is there any time when you want the surface starch?

Heston Blumenthal recommends soaking for 3 x 5 mins in fresh water, or under running water for 2 mins to remove surface starch. soaking also stops the potatoes going brown TEST THIS. 

See Jacques Pépin's New complete techniques for slicing potatoes. Also for deep fried potatoes. Also for potato ovals and various French ways of cooking potatoes that I've never seen (like pommes fondantes)
