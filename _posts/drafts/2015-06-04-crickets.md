This is what a fantasize about saying when I think of most Westerners attitudes towards eating insects.

More than 1,900 insects are known to be eaten[<a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3264e/i3264e00.pdf" target="_blank">ref</a>] by choice around the world, in 80% of nations.[<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/aug/01/insects-food-emissions">ref</a>] But when was the last time you had a roasted mealworm?

The only reason most people in the Western world don't eat insects is because society has convinced us that they are disgusting. Consider the lobster - 200 years ago lobster was used as fish bait and fertiliser[<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-history-of-gourmet-lobster-2013-8" target="_blank">ref</a>]. Lobster shells about a house were seen as a sign of poverty and degradation.[<a href="http://www.psmag.com/business-economics/how-lobster-got-fancy-59440" target="_blank">ref</a>]

If you look at the path the this planet is currently on, it doesn't seem so outrageous to propose that other invertebrates might be destined for similar cultural perception changes to the lobster.

"Over the next 30 years the planet’s human population will increase to nine billion. Already one billion people do not get enough food. The increase will mean more pressure on agricultural land, water, forests, fisheries and biodiversity resources, as well as nutrients and energy supplies".[<a href="http://www.psfk.com/2013/03/edible-insects-food-source.html" target="_blank">ref</a>]

35% of the planet’s methane, 65% of its nitrous oxide and 9% of the carbon dioxide come from livestock farming.[<a href="http://www.psfk.com/2013/03/edible-insects-food-source.html" target="_blank">ref</a>]

"Edible insects emit fewer gases, contain high-quality protein, vitamins and amino acids, and have a high food conversion rate, needing a quarter of the food intake of sheep, and half of pigs and chickens, to produce the same amount of protein. They emit less greenhouse gases and ammonia than cows and can be grown on organic waste."[<a href="http://www.psfk.com/2013/03/edible-insects-food-source.html" target="_blank">ref</a>]

Get a better source of Global population projections. And write about this.

Globally, there are 40 tonnes of insects per 1 human.[<a href="http://www.psfk.com/2013/03/edible-insects-food-source.html" target="_blank">ref</a>]

Acknowledging that eating insects is sustainable, and may actually be fun is the easy bit. The next question is, where do you actually get them?

The obvious answer would be in your garden, but as the #1 rule of foraging goes - never eat anything you're not 100% sure is edible. Identifying insects with certainty turned out to be quite difficult. <em>Maybe I'll buy my first batch</em>, I thought.

I thought I was onto something when I stumbled across <a href="http://www.ediblebugshop.com.au/">http://www.ediblebugshop.com.au/</a>. It seemed legit, and humans appeared to be their target market. But I nearly fainted when I saw the prices. <a href="http://www.ediblebugshop.com.au/p/8549031/plain-roasted-crickets--large.html">$30 for 75g of crickets</a> works out to $400 per kilogram. Some would call that supply and demand, but I think Macklemore said it best:

It turns out that most of the online insect dealers are not selling insects to eat - not for human to eat anyway. I found this out the hard way when I decided to purchase <a href="http://www.livefoods.com.au/live-insects/crickets/pinhead-crickets-qty-of-250">500 pinhead crickets from lifefoods unlimited</a>. It wasn't until I received the package that I realised that I had indeed been swindled and pimped. Probably my own fault for not realizing, but the pinhead crickets I had purchased were literally the size of the head of a pin and intended to be eaten by pet lizards.

After seeing my chickens go crazy when I fed them half my crickets, I figured maybe I was missing out on a good thing. Turning to the internet, I realised that pinhead crickets were actually just baby crickets and would grow with time. Luckily there are a bunch of people out there raising crickets to feed their reptiles and putting instructional videos on YouTube. I decided to give it a shot without worrying about the breeding aspect initially. I found it to be incredibly easy.

I bought a large plastic storage container, and unnecessarily lined the top edge with packing tape so they little buggers could climb out. In the container I placed cut up pieces of egg carton and empty toilet rolls (crickets like places to hide). I also added a metal jar lid stuffed with a paper towel, and filled with enough water to wet the towel, but not enough for the silly crickets to drown themselves in. Lastly I added a range of food scraps and my 250 remaining crickets. Apparently you can give them a heat lamp and they will grow faster but even though it was late autumn I didn't worry about this.

The crickets definitely had a preference for certain foods (carrots, brussels sprouts, and pumpkin), but they didn't eat very much. Of all the vegetable scraps that go into my compost bin, I gave the crickets less than 5% - and that was definitely more than they could eat. In fact, they required so little maintenance that sometimes I forget I even had them. All I did was replace the dried vegetable peelings with fresh ones and refill their water about every 3 days.
