Sometimes when you're on the road, you meet people that you would never meet on your daily business. Last night was a perfect example. Rob and I went out to meet up with a girl we met in the Netherlands in July 2012 and her friends. As we were all getting along swimmingly, an English gentlesir started a conversation with us. It didn't take me long to notice his attire; jeans, a sports jacket, and iPhone headphone strung over his shoulder. In another setting this would've been expected, but in hipster capital of planet earth, I figured that he come to the bar straight from work. Turns out this was true.
"What do you do for a living", I asked.
"Well... I'm a commentator for games"
"Ohh yeah? Which sports do you usually commentate"
"We'll not really sports, more computer games such as Counter Strike"
"Sorry?"
"Yeah I'm in Germany commentating on blah blah championships."

At this point my mind flashed back to 2011 when I was out drinking in Townsville. I met a guy who used to play Counter strike for the best clan in Australia. What was this guy doing in Townsville? He was on a training mission - a training mission with the Australian Counter Terrorist unit. Although this is hilarious, it's not surprising because the armed forces target computer gamers (typically players of first person shooters) for recruitment. Back to last night...

"Let me get this straight. You do live commentary on computer games like Counter Strike"
"Yeah"
"Fuck off!"
"Haha, it's true"
Back in my day, Counter Stike was played by teenagers outside of school hours. In fact I'd heard of people who used to stay up all night playing counter strike and sleep during classes. Maybe that wasn't so ridiculous because according to this guys, Counter Strike is big business. He told me of a decent player he knew - decent, not exceptional - who was making 600,000 â‚¬/year from sponsors. Even if my semi drunken brain didn't store the memory properly, what ever the figure, I was very surprised.
"Jesus! So what kind of numbers so you get watching these games?", I asked, not knowing what to expect.
"The biggest game I've commentated had 27 million viewers, but the biggest we've had is 36 million"

36 million... To put that in perspective, the 3rd game in the 2012 state origin series played in Brisbane, and one of Australia's most watched sporting events, registered 4.8 million viewers.

I couldn't confirm these numbers so I have no idea whether this guys is full of shit or not. If he's legit, that means he's bigger than Ray Warren*. The only thing is that he'd never be recognised by anyone on the street as there are no such thing as day walkers in the world of Counter Strike.
