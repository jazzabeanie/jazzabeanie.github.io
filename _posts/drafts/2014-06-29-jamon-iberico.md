One of the best foods that Spain has to offer is jamón ibérico. It is a type of cured ham produced in the Iberian Region (Spain and Portugal). Most people would be familiar with Italian version called prosciutto. The difference in the quality of jamóns is reflected in the price, which can range from 30€ to over 1000 for a single leg of around 4-8kg[<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/jan/18/worlds-most-expesive-ham-jamon">ref</a>].
