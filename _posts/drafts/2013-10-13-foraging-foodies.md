Why buy food when you can get it for free?  I don't mean steal it from the small kids at school.  I mean forage for it.  I've recently started cooking with Stinging Nettles.  I'm not sure if they have a season or not, but they always seem to be around, so why not use them.  Substitute them when ever you use spinach, just remember to blanch them to remove the sting.  Here is what I've been doing lately:

Nettle soup:
Simmer equal volumes of leek (sliced) and potato (diced to 1" cubes) ~ soft.  Add nettle and simmer 5mins more.  Mash then blend.  Reduce more if required then adjust seasoning.  Serve with 1T butter per bowl.

Nettle bread dip:
Combine 1c mayonnaise, 1 container sour cream, 1 packet onion soup, 1 can waterchestnuts (drained), 1 bunch nettle (blanched).  Blend ~ smooth.  Remove top crust of sourdough loaf, remove bread inside, add dip, replace top crust, serve with bread pieces on the side.

Nettle pesto:
Combine in processor or blender to desired consistancy: 50g pine nuts (toasted), bunch of nettle (blanched for 1 minute), 50g parmesan cheese, 150ml olive oil, 2 cloves garlic.  Store in the fridge with a little extra oil on top.

Chicken and nettle pie:
Brown chicken, remove from pan. Fry onions in butter~soft. Make the roux. Add cream &amp; simmer. Add chicken &amp; a bunch of nettles. Simmer ~ nettle are wilted. Add herbs. Add frozen peas, frozen corn, and S&amp;P. Put in pie. Oven@180C ~ brown on top (move it higher, or turn it up if it's taking to long.
