amazing! I love this. The most basic version can be seen in the masterchef video.

Chop 300-500g potatoes small (1cm cubes) and fry med-high heat. I prefer them to be brown, like Arantxa's version of tortilla de patata. Then remove to a plate. fry 3 eggs until only just cooked. Yolk must be runny. Put these on top of the potatoes then serve. Slice the eggs so that the yolk runs through all the potatoes at the table.

You can also add other things, like onions and capsicum when the potatoes are just starting to brown. You can also add thin slices of jamon or other cured ham on the plate at the end.

This was taken from ever note on the 5/08/14:
<div><span class="highlight">Huevos</span> Estrellados recipe (possibly also known as <span class="highlight">huevos</span> rotos). One of my favorites. Here's how I do it:</div>
<div></div>
<div>Fry potatoes just like for tortilla de patata (cut into 1-2cm cubes/trapezoidal prisms, then fry in oil until starting to brown). OPTIONAL: add onion and capsicum, sliced and continue to fry everything until soft/brown. Add salt, remove to plate, barely fry an egg (yolk should be runny as possible) and put on top over plate. small slices of jamon are a good addition on the plate.</div>

<div>notes 5/08/14:</div>
<div>If you crank the heat from the start, you'll get nice brown potatoes, but they'll be slightly hard inside. If you start on a medium heat, the potatoes will be nicely cooked all the way through. Not sure if this is possible, but could try, cooking through on medium heat, then once cooked, crank the heat and brown them all over. This is similar to the method of the three times cooked potatoes that the top chefs do.</div>
