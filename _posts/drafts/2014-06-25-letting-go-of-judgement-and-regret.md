A few years ago I formed an opinion in my mind that there was no such thing as free will as most people believed it, but I let go of that belief because I thought it was unhelpful and I didn't want it to stop me chasing my goals. But recently I've been thinking, talking to friends, and reading about this and I've rediscovered the idea.

What do I mean when I say there's no such thing as free will? Consider this; unless you have good reason, you are always going to do whatever you want to do. You have no choice in what you want to do. What you want is governed by your genetics, upbringing, social conditioning, hormones, etc. These are all things outside your control. You can choose to act against your desires, but why would you? There must be a reason. That reason is an idea planted in your mind.
