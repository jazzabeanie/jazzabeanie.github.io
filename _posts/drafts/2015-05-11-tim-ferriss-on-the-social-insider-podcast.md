title: "Tim Ferriss on the Social Insider Podcast"

I stopped listening to podcasts with people interviewing Tim Ferriss because they're all the same. If you've read his books and listened two a few interview with him, you don't need anything else. When I heard that he talked about suicide on the Social Triggers Insider podcast I thought I'd check it out because I'd never heard him talk about suicide. It turns out that I'd never heard Ferriss talk or write about 90% of the content in the podcast. Derek Halpern does to Tim Ferriss what Ferriss usually does to his guests - he asks the specific kind of questions most interviewers don't ask.

As usual, after listening to the podcast I went the show notes and found them to be useless. So I've done my best to extract the good info.

This post summaries the Social Triggers Insider podcast, 05/05/2015

Show notes from the website: http://socialtriggers.com/tim-ferriss-suicide-fear-of-failure-and-the-secret-to-success/

More specifically, we’ll cover:

* The quickest way to cure any bad mood (use this when you’re feeling down, mad, or just need a pick-me-up)

* What happens when people crack under pressure – and how to prevent it from happening to you.

* How to eliminate the fear of failure TODAY

* And of course: how Tim Ferriss became the Tim Ferriss we know today (a best-selling author, wildly successful investor, and entrepreneur).

Now listen to the podcast.

And if you have any experience with anything we talked about, I’d love for you to open up in the comments.

Both Tim and I talk about the good and the bad. And it’s OKAY if everything isn’t as perfect as it seems on the outside.

Share your story in the comments.

Show Notes:

1. The Tim Ferriss Show (His podcast)

2. The Tim Ferriss Experiment (his tv show)

3. “Productivity” Tricks for the Neurotic, Manic-Depressive, and Crazy (Like Me)

P.S. I’ve had an on and off again relationship with podcasting. And while this is the first podcast I released in more than a year, I believe it was worth the wait. So listen to it today.
