<p>In mid 2012, after a degree in civil engineering and two years of work as a professional engineer, I quit my job, started this blog and left Australia to go traveling and pursue my personal legend.</p>

<p>The next two years were spent living in Edinburgh, working at a hostel, and taking small trips around Europe. In April 2014 I spent 6 weeks riding my pushbike through the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and France to arrive in San Sebastian in the North of Spain. I then lived in Cadiz in the South of Spain where I focused on eating delicious food and learning flamenco guitar. In September 2014 I traveled through Nepal and India before returning to Brisbane in December.</p>

<p>This blog is about life’s pleasures of food, music and travel.</p>
